 Proposal overview
Title: Service Agreement & Project Deliverables (Noviq ↔ JHL).
Purpose: Document scope, payment terms, recurring support, and signatures for a project (e.g., development + hosting + add-ons).
🔎 Sections & content
Header & Parties

Page title and parties line (Noviq — Jean Claude Dergham, JHL — Fadya Wahab).
#client-name input (editable client name).
1. Comprehensive Project Scope

Several scope items describing deliverables (product modules, intelligence, admin panel, donation gateway).
2. Financial Terms & Add-ons

Primary investment table with Total Development Fee (example: €900).
Optional domain package details.
3. Payment Structures

Three options (radio inputs):
Milestone (30% upfront),
Installment (50% upfront, months),
Custom (custom upfront % via #upfront-pct, min 10%).
Custom panel (#custom-panel) with inputs:
#base-fee, #upfront-pct, #installments, #fee-on-full.
Calculation results (upfront amount, remaining, monthly, service total, total).
Print-only Payment Summary

#print-summary (visible only when printing) with ps-* fields (option, base, upfront, months, monthly, fees, total, signatures).
4. Recurring Support & Hosting

Text explaining first-year free support and annual renewal fee (€300).
Signature Blocks

Two signature blocks:
Noviq (Licensor) with #noviq-signature-img, #noviq-sign-date, draw/upload UI (#noviq-canvas, #noviq-upload-file) and status (#noviq-upload-status).
Licensee (JHL) with analogous IDs (#licensee-signature-img, #licensee-sign-date, etc.).
Draw, upload, clear actions; images persisted and shown in print.
⚙️ Interactive behavior & rules
Upfront % min = 10% enforced in UI and in calculations.
Recalculation updates amounts live and refreshes populatePrintSummary().
Print flow: bottom Print Proposal button (#print-btn-bottom) saves locally then opens print dialog. Print hides interactive elements and shows print-only summary.
Dirty-tracking: changes set window.proposalDirty; beforeunload warns if not printed (to encourage printing to save).
💾 Persistence & storage
Local-first:
localStorage for quick restore (lastSavedProposal, signature data URIs).
IndexedDB stores in proposals and signatures (via openIDB, idbPut, idbGet).
No remote save by default (Supabase code removed per your instruction).
✅ Notes & suggestions
The file indext.html is a single-file, self-contained interactive proposal — ready to print and persist locally.

Want the print summary to hide "Months" and "Monthly" instead of showing "N/A"? I can change that. 💡
If you want, I can also generate a React clone scaffold or an export (PDF) flow next. 🔧
Would you like a plain-English summary to include in the printed proposal (short "What this contract covers" paragraph)?
